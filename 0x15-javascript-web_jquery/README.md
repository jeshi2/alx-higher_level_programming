# JavaScript Web jQuery

This repository contains JavaScript scripts that demonstrate various tasks using vanilla JavaScript and the jQuery API. Each script is associated with a specific task and includes instructions on how to use it.

## Prerequisites

- A web browser to test the scripts.
- jQuery (for scripts that use the jQuery API).

## Resources

Before working on these tasks, it's recommended to review the following resources to gain a better understanding of JavaScript and jQuery:
